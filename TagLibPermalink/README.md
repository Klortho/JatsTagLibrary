Browser Extension - TagLibPermalink
===================================

This extension works in Firefox and in Chrome.  It may work in other browsers, but hasn't
been tested.

You can watch a [short video](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/staff/maloneyc/JatsTagLibrary/TagSetPermalink.mp4)
about how to install it, and what it does.


### To install in Firefox

1.  Install the [Greasemonkey
    add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2.  Go to the GitHub description page for this extension,
    [here](TagLibPermalink.user.js)
3.  Click the "Raw" button.  You should see a pop-up window asking if you want to install this
    user script.
4.  Click "Install".  You should see a message, "TagLibPermalink installed successfully."

### To install in Google Chrome (native)

1.  Go to the GitHub description page for this extension,
    [here](TagLibPermalink.user.js)
2.  '''Right-click''' on "Raw", and choose "Save link as", and then save the file to disk.
3.  On the button for the just-downloaded file, at the bottom of the browser window,
    right-click and select "show in folder" to bring up the file in the filesystem window (for
    example, Windows Explorer).
4.  In the Chrome window, click on the settings button, and click "Settings".  On the left-hand
    side, click "Extensions"
5.  Now, drag the user script from the filesystem window onto the Chrome extensions window.
    You should see a pop-up asking if you want to "Add TagLibraryPermalink?"
6.  Click "Add".

### To install in Google Chrome (tampermonkey)

If your Google Chrome extensions are restricted by your admins (as is the case in one
government organization that I know of) you might be able to install it anyway with
Tampermonkey.

1.  Find Tampermonkey in the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore),
    and install it.
2.  Go to the GitHub description page for this extension,
    [here](TagLibPermalink.user.js)
3.  Click the "Raw" button.  The script should open in a new Tampermonkey tab, and a dialog box
    should appear asking if you want to install it.
4.  Click "OK".

### Try it out

Navigate to any element documentation page.  For example, starting at the
[Article Authoring Tag Library](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.0/),
navigate to _Elements_ → _&lt;abbrev&gt;_.  You should see "permalink" in the upper-right hand corner.
Click on that, and verify that your browser address bar now has
"http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.0/?elem=abbrev".
