of NISO Z39.96-2011, JATS: Journal Article Tag Suite. This Tag Library is not 
a part of NISO Z39.96. It contains non-normative information that is intended 
to be helpful to users of NISO Z39.96, including: <ul class="bullist"><li>Remarks on usage and relationships among elements and attributes;</li><li>Structural Diagrams, showing the element hierarchy;</li><li>Tagging examples;</li><li>Best practice recommendations;</li><li>Implementation advice;</li><li>Discussion of accessibility and the Tag Suite; and</li><li>Pointers to (non-normative) downloadable versions of DTDs, XSDs, and RNGs that implement
     the NISO JATS Tag Sets.</li></ul> </p><p class="para">The intent of the Journal Article Tag Suite is to provide a common format in which
   publishers and archives can exchange journal content. The Suite provides a set of XML schema
   modules that define elements and attributes for describing the textual and graphical content of
   journal articles as well as some non-article material such as letters, editorials, and book and
   product reviews.</p><div class="section"><a name="aut-set-intro"></a><h3 class="header">Introduction to the Article Authoring Tag Set</h3><div class="section"><a name="aut-rationale"></a><h4 class="header">Rationale</h4><p class="para">The Article Authoring Tag Set creates a standardized format for new journal articles that
     can be used by authors to submit publications to journals and to archives such as PubMed
     Central. While in theory the document scope is the same as for the Publishing Tag Set, in
     practice Authoring defines elements and attributes that describe the content of typical
     research-style journal articles.</p><p class="para">This is a Tag Set optimized for authorship of new journal articles, where regularization
     and control of content is important, and where it is useful rather than harmful to have only
     one way to tag a structure. Therefore, Authoring is more <em>prescriptive</em> than <em>descriptive</em> and includes many
     elements whose content must occur in a specified order.</p><p class="para">Since an author is assumed to be creating and submitting an article for submission to a
     journal or journals, no publishing history or journal-specific information has been included in
     this Authoring Tag Set.</p><p class="para">Since no assumptions can be made concerning the processing software or editorial situation
     that will receive an article authored in this Tag Set, tagging that forces specific formatting
     has also been avoided. There is no way for an author to number his/her lists explicitly, for
     example, or to manually number the cited references, since many journals have their own
     citation policies and publication styles. Numbers for the cited references must be generated by
     the publisher’s software to match editorial policy and established practice.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="aut-scope"></a><h4 class="header">Scope</h4><p class="para">By design, this is a model for journal articles, such as the typical research article
     found in an STM journal, and not a model for complete journals. This Tag Set does not include
     an overarching model for a collection of articles. In addition, the following journal material
     is not described by this Tag Set: <ul class="bullist"><li>Company, product, or service display advertising;</li><li>Job search or classified advertising;</li><li>Calendars, meeting schedules, and conference announcements (except as these can be
       tagged as ordinary articles, sub-articles, or sections within articles); and</li><li>Material specific to an individual journal, such as Author Guidelines, Policy and Scope
       statements, editorial or advisory boards, detailed indicia, etc.</li></ul> </p></div><div class="section"><a name="aut-overview"></a><h4 class="header">Structural Overview</h4><p class="para">The Article Authoring Tag Set defines a document that is a top-level component of a
     journal such as an article, a book or product review, or a letter to the editor. Each such
     document is composed of one or more parts; if there is more than one part, they must appear in
     the following order:</p><ul class="bullist"><li>Front matter (required). The article front matter contains the metadata for the article
       (also called article header information), for example, the article title, the names of the
       contributor(s), and the abstract. This is not textual front matter as appears in books,
       rather this is bibliographic information about the article.</li><li>Body of the article (required). The body of the article is the main textual and graphic
       content of the article. This usually consists of paragraphs and sections, which may
       themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars (boxed text), etc.</li><li>Back matter for the article (optional). If present, the article back matter contains
       information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary, appendix, or list of
       cited references.</li></ul></div><div class="section"><a name="aut-developed"></a><h4 class="header">Tag Sets Developed from the Suite</h4><p class="para">This Tag Set is one of several created from the Suite. Information about these Tag Sets

      documents or learn how the journal article model is constructed, here is a good way to start. <ul class="bullist"><li>Read the Tag Library General Introduction, taking particular note of the next section
        that describes the parts of the Tag Library so you will know what resources are
        available.</li><li>If you do not know the symbols used in the Document Hierarchy diagrams, then
 read the “<a href="n-.html#pub-nearfar-key">Key to the Near &amp; 
Far® Diagrams</a>”. </li><li>Scan the Document Hierarchy diagrams to get a good sense of the top-level elements and
        their contents. (Find what is inside an <a href="n-ce20.html" target="main" title="Article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a>, now what is inside each of the three large pieces of an article, keep working your way
        down.)</li><li>Pick an element from one of the diagrams. Look up the element in the Elements Section
        to find the full name of the element, its definition, usage notes, content allowed, and any
        attributes. Look up one of the attributes to find its full name, usage notes, and potential
        values.</li></ul> </p><p class="para">Finally, if you are interested in conversion from a particular source: <ul class="bullist"><li>Look at an article in a printed or online journal or look at the DTD/schema for the
        other journal. <ul class="bullist"><li>Can all the information you want to store from an article fit into the models shown
          in the diagrams?</li><li>Do you have, or know how to get, all the information the models require? Will that
          information always be available for documents that are complete and correct?</li><li>How difficult will it be to identify the parts of the information using the elements
          and attributes described in these models? Would changes to one or more models make this
          easier?</li></ul> </li><li>Now look at some non-article content, such as a news column, a book review, or some
        letters to the editor. Are there tags to handle all these article types and all their
        components?</li></ul> </p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="aut-structure"></a><h4 class="header">Structure of This Tag Library</h4><p class="para">This Tag Library contains the following sections:</p><div class="deflist"><table class="deflisttable"><tr class="row1"><td class="dterm"><p>How To Use (Read Me First</p></td><td class="ddef"><p class="para">How to make best use of this Tag Library to reference XML tags, become familiar with

        element-type name) that is used in tagged documents, in the DTDs/schemas, and by XML
        software; and an “element name” (usually longer) that provides a fuller, more
        descriptive name for the benefit of human readers. For example, a tag name might be
        <a href="n-p950.html" target="main" title="Quote, Displayed"><span class="elementtag">&lt;disp-quote&gt;</span></a> with the corresponding element
        name <a href="n-p950.html" target="main" title="<disp-quote&gt;"><span class="elementname">Quote, Displayed</span></a>, or a tag name might be

        all the elements in which the first column element may occur. For example, if the first
