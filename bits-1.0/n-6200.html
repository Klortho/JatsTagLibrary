  <p class="para">Tag Libraries provide interactive documentation for a Tag Set that you can access
  through Web browsers. Separate Tag Libraries have been set up for this BITS Book Tag Set as well
  as for each of the NISO JATS Journal Tag Sets (Journal Archiving, Journal Publishing, and Article
  Authoring). Each Tag Library provides specific information, such as:</p>

  <ul class="bullist">
    <li>Alphabetical lists of the element, attribute, and parameter entity names defined in the Tag
    Set (the last of these is mainly useful to users who customize this Tag Set);</li>

    <li>Special overviews such as an “element context table” of what elements each element may
    occur within;</li>

    <li>Tutorial chapters on concepts that are complex or that involve many different XML element
    types, such as tagging bibliographic citations;</li>

    <li>Many links between related elements and discussions; and</li>

    <li>An index where you can look up concepts under a variety of names or descriptions, and reach
    the relevant parts of the documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="para">You can use the Tag Library as a reference to look up XML tags and how to use
  them; to browse around and familiarize yourself with this Tag Set; to see examples of correct or
  recommended usage; and even to find guidance for how to implement software to handle documents
  that are marked up using this Tag Set.</p>

  <p class="para">At the top level of each Tag Set’s Tag Library there are several main
  sections:</p>

  <ul class="bullist">
    <li>How To Use (Read Me First)</li>

    <li>Root Element(s)</li>

    <li>General Introduction</li>

    <li>Elements</li>

    <li>Attributes</li>

    <li>Parameter Entities</li>

    <li>Document Hierarchy Diagrams</li>

    <li>Common Tagging Practice</li>

    <li>Accessibility</li>

    <li>Implementing This Tag Set</li>

    <li>Element Context Table</li>

    <li>Index</li>
  </ul>

    <h3 class="header">Moving Around in the Tag Library</h3>

    <p class="para">As with most Web documents, you can click on links to travel from one topic to
    another and use your browser’s “Back” button to backtrack through previously-visited pages. On
    most pages there is a Navigation Bar on the left, as shown below. This provides links to each
    main section. In addition, next to each main section’s title there is a small right-pointing
    triangle (<img class="inlinegraphic" src="graphics/rarr.png" />). Clicking on it will show the
    list of sub-topics within each main section, and you can then click on a sub-topic to go to the
    corresponding discussion. To collapse the expanded list, click on the down-pointing triangle
    (<img class="inlinegraphic" src="graphics/darr.png" />).</p>

    <p class="para">For example, clicking on the triangle to the left of the word “Elements” will
    show a list of all the XML element types such as <a href="n-7tr0.html" target="main" title=
    "Paragraph"><span class="elementtag">&lt;p&gt;</span></a> and <a href="n-7ez0.html" target=
    "main" title="Table (NISO JATS table model)"><span class="elementtag">&lt;table&gt;</span></a>
    that are defined in this Tag Set. Because there are many element types, you will likely have to
    scroll down to find a particular one (using the scroll-bar on the Navigation Bar, not the main
    scroll-bar for the entire browser window).(<img class="inlinegraphic" src=
    "graphics/listone.png" />)</p>

    <ul class="bullist">
      <li>The “Common Tagging Practice” section contains descriptions of more general issues in how
      to use this Tag Set. For example, affiliations and keywords involve numerous elements,
      attributes, and general design choices. These are discussed in special sections, rather than
      under some particular related element(s). These sections are important for learning to use
      this Tag Set well, and links to them are provided from elements and attributes to which they
      are especially relevant.</li>

      <li>Clicking on a name in the “Elements” section will take you to a page for that element,
      with detailed information about its use, content, and permissible contexts.</li>

      <li>Similarly, the “Attributes” section lists all the available attributes. An attribute that
      is available on many elements has only one description (the description lists all the
      elements on which the attribute is available). This section also provides key details such as
      permitted, recommended, or example values.</li>

      <li>The “Parameter Entities” section describes entities that are used in the formal Tag Set
      definition (DTD). Most users can ignore these, but they are important if you wish to
      customize this Tag Set.</li>

      <li>The “Element Context Table” has an alphabetical list of available elements. For each one,
      it shows all the elements that can directly contain it. This is a great way to find out
      whether a certain element can be used in a certain context. This information can also be
      gleaned from the element’s Element page under “This element may be contained in”.</li>

      <li>Finally, there is an “Index” section that works like the index at the back of many books.
      You can use it to find where a given item or topic is discussed. The index lists elements,
      attributes, and discussion topics under many related names and descriptions, so if you don’t
      know the exact tag name to use for something, try looking in the index under various related
      words, and you will most likely find a reference to the applicable tag or attribute.</li>

      <li>The “Document Hierarchy Diagrams” section illustrates portions of this Tag Set’s
      structure that are nested or that have complex structures. This information can also be
      gleaned from the element’s Element page under “Model Description”. The diagrams use some
      special symbols that are described below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">In all these sections except the Document Hierarchy Diagrams, when the text
    mentions specific element types, attributes, or parameter entities, the name is linked to the
    page that describes that item. This makes it easy to access related information.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <a name="bits-taglib-intro-element-pages" id="bits-taglib-intro-element-pages"></a>

    <h3 class="header">The Element Page</h3>

    <p class="para">These pages start out with the XML name of the element they describe, followed
    by a more English-like, descriptive name and a definition. Many elements also have remarks that
    give further details, a discussion of best practice, notes that may be helpful to users that
    need to convert data into this Tag Set from other sources, and cross-references.</p>

    <p class="para">There is also a description of exactly what elements are allowed within the
    element and in what combinations. This information is provided in three forms:</p>

    <ul class="bullist">
      <li><strong>Content Model</strong> — the “raw” content model in XML syntax. This may contain
      parameters entities, of the form “%name;”, which often stand in for commonly-used lists of
      elements. Users not familiar with formal XML (DTD) syntax will likely prefer the “Expanded
      Content Model” or the “Description”.</li>

      <li><strong>Expanded Content Model</strong> — the content model with all parameter entities
      expanded to their ultimate values. This list directly shows all the elements that the
      described element can contain, and in what combination.</li>

      <li><strong>Description</strong> — a text description of the allowable content, which is much
      longer than the content models, but should be readily understandable without having to learn
      the details of content models and their punctuation. These descriptions often refer to
      categories of elements, such as “the address linking elements”. These categories correspond
      to parameter entities that are shown in the “raw” content model, and are re-used in many
      places.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">For many elements, the “Document Hierarchy Diagrams” provides a fourth
    descriptive form. This form is described below.</p>

    <p class="para">Most element pages include specific examples that show how the element can be
    used, including any relevant context. These examples have all been tested and validated;
    however, portions are often left out or replaced by “...” to keep examples manageable. In
    addition, the most relevant parts of examples are highlighted so they are easy to find.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <a name="bits-taglib-intro-attribute-pages" id="bits-taglib-intro-attribute-pages"></a>

    <h3 class="header">The Attribute Page</h3>

    <p class="para">Attribute pages are organized very much like element pages. However, because an
    attribute cannot have sub-elements, the description instead tells which elements can use the
    attribute, what kind of attribute it is, and what the permitted and default values are (the
    default value is used when the attribute is not specified at all on a particular instance of an
    element).</p>

    <p class="para">Some common kinds of attributes are:</p>

    <div class="deflist">
      <table class="deflisttable">
        <tr class="row1">
          <td class="dterm">
            <p>An XML identifier (<tt>ID</tt>)</p>
          </td>

          <td class="ddef">
            <p class="para">This kind of attribute must have a value that is an XML NAME, which can
            consist of XML name characters (alphabetical characters, digits, period, underscore,
            and hyphen), and cannot start with a digit. Every <tt>ID</tt> attribute value in a
            single document must be unique and provides a way to link or refer to its element (for
            example, using the <a href="n-nj52.html" target="main" title=
            "X (cross) Reference"><span class="elementtag">&lt;xref&gt;</span></a> element).
            <tt>ID</tt> attributes are generally named <a href="n-4qu2.html" target="main" title=
            "Document Internal Identifier"><span class="attrtag">@id</span></a>.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="row0">
          <td class="dterm">
            <p>An identifier (<tt>IDREF</tt>)</p>
          </td>

          <td class="ddef">
            <p class="para">This kind of attribute must have a value that is the same as some
            <tt>ID</tt> value in the same document. <tt>IDREF</tt>s appear on elements that refer
            to other elements such as <a href="n-nj52.html" target="main" title=
            "X (cross) Reference"><span class="elementtag">&lt;xref&gt;</span></a>. <tt>IDREF</tt>
            attributes are generally named <a href="n-45v2.html" target="main" title=
            "Reference to an Identifier"><span class="attrtag">@rid</span></a>. Some <a href=
            "n-45v2.html" target="main" title="Reference to an Identifier"><span class=
            "attrtag">@rid</span></a> attributes are of type <tt>IDREFS</tt>, which is simply a
            space-separated list of <tt>IDREF</tt> values.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="row1">
          <td class="dterm">
            <p>Text, numbers, or special characters (<tt>CDATA</tt>)</p>
          </td>

          <td class="ddef">
            <p class="para">These attributes can take any string value at all. If the attribute
            value is surrounded by single quotes, then single quotes cannot appear inside; if the
            attribute value is surrounded by double quotes, then double quotes cannot appear
            inside. In either case, the prohibited character can instead be represented by an XML
            character reference such as “&amp;apos;”. XML elements cannot be placed within
            attribute values.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="row0">
          <td class="dterm">
            <p>“xxx-type” attributes</p>
          </td>

          <td class="ddef">
            <p class="para">There are many attributes whose names end in “<tt>-type</tt>”. They are
            generally <tt>CDATA</tt> attributes as described above. They are typically assigned
            tokens as values, containing no spaces. Typically if there are spaces in the value,
            they separate multiple independent tokens, all of which apply. For example, some
            element might be both of type “<tt>important</tt>” and “<tt>normative</tt>”, and be
            given type “<tt>important normative</tt>”. In many cases, the Tag Library gives
            suggested values for such attributes. Unless specifically stated otherwise, those
            values are not the only values permitted.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p class="para">Finally, there may be a “Restrictions” section that specifies if the attribute
    must always be specified or is optional.</p>

    <h3 class="header">The Document Hierarchy Diagrams</h3>

    <p class="para">These diagrams illustrate portions of the hierarchical (nested) structure of
    this Tag Set. Each diagram has one element “root” and may illustrate the structures of several
    additional elements. For each element illustrated, its name appears in boxes on the left, with
    lines to boxes for each of its possible child-elements, which are in a column on the right.</p>

    <p class="para">Boxes for child elements can have names and/or symbols within. If the box has
    merely “...”, it means that the actual content has been omitted, to save space or improve
    clarity. If it has merely an icon of a page with lines, it stands for text content rather than
    an actual element.</p>

    <p class="para">If a box has an element name, then symbols at the left end of a box indicate
    whether that element is required and/or repeatable. These symbols are called “occurrence
    indicators”:</p>
