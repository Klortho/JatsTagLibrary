books that is based on the Journal Article
Tag Suite (ANSI/NISO Z39-96-2012). The intent of the BITS is to provide a common format in which
publishers and archives can exchange book content, whether an entire book or merely a book part such
as chapter. The Suite provides a set of XML schema modules that define elements and attributes for
describing the textual and graphical content of books and book components as well as a package
element for book part interchange.</p><div class="section"><a name="bits-rationale"></a><h4 class="header">Rationale</h4><p class="para">The spring-board for developing the BITS was the observation that a JATS-based XML
book model, or a set of related book models, would be useful to a wide variety of publishers of
professional and scholarly books, especially but not exclusively to publishers who are already using
one of the NISO JATS journal article models and looking for a compatible model for their books. Just as the wide support of the NISO Journal Article Tag Sets enabled many journal publishers to move to XML, a well-supported XML book model (appropriate to their needs and compatible with current citation management tools) would enable book publishers to move to XML and through XML to electronic publication and archiving.</p><p class="para">Why add yet another book model to the world? By developing book model(s) based on the
existing NISO JATS Tag Suite, we hope to enable publishers to include their books in the systems that already create, manage, publish, and archive their journal articles and to build on the investment they, as well as their suppliers and vendors, have made in learning and developing around JATS.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-purpose"></a><h4 class="header">Purpose</h4><p class="para">The goal for the BITS is to make a tag set adequate for supporting interchange,
archiving, format-conversion, and publishing for scientific, technical, and medical books. As was
true for JATS, the intent of the BITS is to support marking up the content of material so that it can be reused, repurposed, and made more discoverable. This purpose implies, as it does in JATS, that the ability to reproduce a particular book format is <em>not</em> a goal.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-scope"></a><h4 class="header">Scope</h4><p class="para">The BITS Book Interchange DTD is a superset customization of the ANSI/NISO JATS Z39.96-2012 Journal
Archiving and Interchange Tag Set, with added material to describe STM books, book components such
as chapters, and information concerning the inclusion of books and book components in book series.
The Tag Set describes both the metadata and the narrative content of a book, both the metadata and
narrative content for book components, and collection-level metadata for book sets and book series, 
when a book part is associated with one or more such collections.</p><p class="para">The BITS book model is intended to support scholarly, reference, higher education,
medical, and technical books. Just as the NISO JATS journal article models do not attempt to support
magazines or any of a wide variety of other serial publications, the book models are not intended
describe trade books, cook books, grade school text books, or any of the wide variety of books
outside the scientific, technical, and medical realm. Although this work is being supported by the
National Library of Medicine, this book model should be usable beyond life sciences publishing, as
the NISO JATS journal article models are useful in physics, social sciences, linguistics, and poetry.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-design-basis"></a><h4 class="header">Design Basis</h4><p class="para">An explicit goal was the creation of models that would enable the construction of books
comprised of articles. The intent was to enable article bodies to pass nearly unchanged into book
parts, with changes to only the outer wrapping element and certain book-specific metadata reflecting the move from an issue of a journal to the chapter of a book.</p><p class="para">The BITS Book Interchange Tag Set was constructed using the modules in the NISO JATS
and adding additional modules to define components that are specific to books. The BITS was based on
NISO JATS Version 1.1d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39-96-2012), which is the latest iteration of the original NLM journal
article DTDs. This relationship between JATS and the BITS was quite strictly defined: “The models should be as similar as possible and only as different as necessary.” Therefore if JATS had a named structure and that structure also occurs in books, the JATS name (and, to the extent possible, the JATS content model and attributes) were used. </p></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-book-part-naming"></a><h4 class="header">Book Part Naming</h4><p class="para">Concerning the many terms used to name components of books (such as chapter, part,
unit, module, lesson, segment, division, and section), the BITS is entirely agnostic. The BITS divides books into book parts and leaves it up to the publisher to call them chapters or units or anything else.</p><p class="para">There are, however, a few named book parts in the BITS, largely in the narrative front
matter and the back matter of a book. Because the BITS, like its JATS parent, does not lead
publishers but tries to consolidate current publishing practice, the following named book parts
have been built into the BITS:<ul class="bullist"><li>Dedication</li><li>Foreword</li><li>Preface</li><li>Table of Contents  (a structural Table of Contents that can be edited)</li><li>Index (a structural index that can be edited)</li></ul></p><p class="para">Similarly, publishers give many names to collections of books and/or book components,
such as book sets, book series, monograph series, and the like. The BITS is entirely agnostic concerning such collective nouns and merely collects the metadata naming such a grouping.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-overview"></a><h4 class="header">Book Structural Overview</h4><p class="para">There are two top-level elements in the BITS Book:
<ul class="bullist"><li>the Book element (<a href="n-5750.html" target="main" title="Book"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book&gt;</span></a>), to contain an entire document such as a textbook or a monograph; and</li><li>the Book Wrapper element (<a href="n-wk80.html" target="main" title="Book Part Wrapper"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-part-wrapper&gt;</span></a>), to contain a book part such as a “chapter” or “module” that needs to be handled as a discrete unit.</li></ul></p><div class="section"><a name="bits-book-overview"></a><h4 class="header">A Book</h4><p class="para">Just as a NISO JATS top-level article element may contain only the metadata for an article and none of the narrative text, a BITS top-level book element may contain only the metadata for a book and not the narrative text of the book or any book part. This allows publishers and archives to use JATS and BITS for exchange of metadata even when not preserving the textual content of a document in XML.</p><p class="para">If both the metadata and the text of a book are to be tagged in XML, a book may be composed of the following components:<ul class="bullist"><li><strong>Collection Metadata</strong> (optional).Bibliographic metadata describing a book set or series to which this book or book part belongs.</li><li><strong>Book Metadata</strong> (optional). The book metadata element (<a href="n-8r50.html" target="main" title="Book Metadata (Whole Book)"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-meta&gt;</span></a>) contains the metadata for the book, for example, the title of the book, the date of publication, the publisher, a copyright statement, etc. This is not the textual front matter that appears at the beginning of a book, rather this is bibliographic information <em>about</em> the book.</li><li><strong>Front Matter</strong> (optional). If present, the front matter
element (<a href="n-nrt0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front-matter&gt;</span></a>) contains the textual front material for a book, such as a Dedication, Foreword, or Preface.</li><li><strong>Body of the Book</strong> (optional). If present, the body of
the book element (<a href="n-sn50.html" target="main" title="Body of the Book"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-body&gt;</span></a>) contains the narrative of the work, the main textual and graphic content of the book. The body of a book contains book parts (<a href="n-nj50.html" target="main" title="Book Part"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-part&gt;</span></a>), which may be called parts, sections, chapters, modules, lessons, or whatever divisions a publisher has named.<br class="br">Book parts are recursive, so they may contain other book parts. For example, “Part 3” of a book could contain several “Chapter”s, each of which could have a foreword, the body of the chapter, one or more appendices, and a reference list.</li><li><strong>Back Matter for the Book</strong> (optional). If present, the
book back matter element (<a href="n-xe50.html" target="main" title="Book Back Matter"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-back&gt;</span></a>) contains information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary, appendix, or list of cited references. The back matter may also contain Floating Material (<a href="n-8tt0.html" target="main" title="Floating Element Group"><span class="elementtag">&lt;floats-group&gt;</span></a>), a container element for all the “floating” objects such as tables,
figures, and sidebars in a book. The back matter of book parts (<a href="n-4p30.html" target="main" title="Back Matter for a Book Part"><span class="elementtag">&lt;back&gt;</span></a>) and the <a href="n-wk80.html" target="main" title="Book Part Wrapper"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-part-wrapper&gt;</span></a>may also their own, separate contain
Floating Material (<a href="n-8tt0.html" target="main" title="Floating Element Group"><span class="elementtag">&lt;floats-group&gt;</span></a>).</li></ul></p></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-wrapper-overview"></a><h4 class="header">A Book Part Wrapper</h4><p class="para">The other top-level element in this Tag Set is the book part wrapper (<a href="n-wk80.html" target="main" title="Book Part Wrapper"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-part-wrapper&gt;</span></a>), which contains a single book part to be interchanged, along with the metadata that describes the book part and collection metadata that describes a grouping (such as a virtual book) of which the book part is a member. A book part may be associated with many collections. The collection metadata for each book can be stored in the book document instance.</p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-roads-not-taken"></a><h4 class="header">The Roads Not Taken</h4><p class="para">The BITS Book Tag Set is not based on the NLM Book (Bookshelf) Tag Set that was part
of the NLM predecessor to JATS. Instead, the BITS book model is based on the NISO JATS Journal
Archiving and Interchange Tag Set (known as “Green” from the colors of the Tag
Library pages), with book metadata in the BITS replacing the journal and issue metadata from JATS
Archiving.</p><p class="para">By design, there are some structures which have been modeled as elements in other
public book DTDS and schemas that were not named explicitly in the BITS, including:<ul class="bullist"><li><strong>Book Metadata</strong>
              — The book metadata is held in the element <a href="n-8r50.html" target="main" title="Book Metadata (Whole Book)"><span class="elementtag">&lt;book-meta&gt;</span></a>, which is not named “front” as is the corresponding element holding
the article metadata for a JATS journal article. Book metadata is unlike that for journal
articles, making this one of the real changes from ANSI/NIOS JATS.</li><li><strong>CCC Statement</strong>
              — There is no element with this <em>name</em> in the BITS. In the BITS, this may be tagged as a license paragraph (<a href="n-nbg0.html" target="main" title="License Paragraph"><span class="elementtag">&lt;license-p&gt;</span></a>) inside a license statement (<a href="n-eqg0.html" target="main" title="License Information"><span class="elementtag">&lt;license&gt;</span></a>), which may include the price tagged as a <a href="n-zph0.html" target="main" title="Price"><span class="elementtag">&lt;price&gt;</span></a>. The <a href="n-znw2.html" target="main" title="Type of License"><span class="attrtag">@license-type</span></a> attribute may be set to “CCC-statement” to identify the information.</li><li><strong>Colophon</strong>
              — In the BITS, this may be tagged as a paragraph, as a section within the body of the book, as a book part in the back matter of a book, or as a book part.</li><li><strong>Contributor List</strong>
              — There is no special structure for theses lists; they can be tagged using ordinary structures (lists, definition lists, tables, paragraphs, etc.) within a <a href="n-bit0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter Part"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front-matter-part&gt;</span></a>, within the narrative front matter, or within the back matter. Such lists should be written
in addition the contributor names (<a href="n-kzw0.html" target="main" title="Contributor"><span class="elementtag">&lt;contrib&gt;</span></a>) listed in the metadata
of a book or book part.</li><li><strong>Frontispiece</strong>
              — No special structure was named in the BITS; the material should be tagged using ordinary structures within a <a href="n-bit0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter Part"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front-matter-part&gt;</span></a> as part of the narrative front matter. While the <a href="n-2f90.html" target="main" title="Styled Special (Subject) Content"><span class="elementtag">&lt;styled-content&gt;</span></a> element “could” be used to capture the special formatting typical in a Frontispiece, this is discouraged. The typical purpose for tagging a Frontispiece  is to make the information content discoverable, not to replicate the look and feel of the document.</li><li><strong>Introduction</strong>
              — There will be no explicitly named “Introduction” element,
because this name may be applied at many levels: to a front-matter component, a section of the body,
or an entire book part.</li><li><strong>Map Group</strong>
              — This NLM-specific element was used in the previous NLM Book Tag Set;
it was not replicated in the BITS.</li></ul></p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="bits-howto"></a><h3 class="header">How to Read This Tag Library</h3><div class="section"><a name="bits-terms"></a><h4 class="header">Terms and Definitions</h4><div class="deflist"><table class="deflisttable"><tr class="row1"><td class="dterm"><p>Element</p></td><td class="ddef"><p class="para">Elements are nouns, like “speech” and “speaker”,
