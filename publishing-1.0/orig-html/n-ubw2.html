    <h3 class="header">Tagging Sub-articles</h3>

    <p class="para">A <a href="n-2fg0.html" target="main" title="Sub-article"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a> is an article of any type (letter, reply, review,
    short new piece) which is entirely contained within another article.</p>

    <p class="para">The containing (main) article, the sub-article(s), or both, are often quite
    small. For example, an article titled “Member News Column” may contain one paragraph
    introducing the news items (main article) and then contain three longer news stories
    (sub-articles). An example of a longer article is a summary article which begins with a full
    review of the literature (main article) and includes several small related essays
    (sub-articles).</p>

    <p class="para">Many journals have regular columns such as “News”, “Book Reviews”, or “50 years
    ago in the journal”, which consist of a series of small entries grouped under a single article
    title. The group as a whole might have some introductory material in addition to the title.
    Each of these columns could be tagged as an article with the introductory material as its
    direct content and the various entries as sub-articles.</p>

    <p class="para">How much metadata goes with a sub-article is a business decision. Sub-articles
    usually inherit all journal metadata (<a href="n-wzx0.html" target="main" title=
    "Journal Metadata"><span class="elementtag">&lt;journal-meta&gt;</span></a>) from the parent
    article, however, the <a href="n-2fg0.html" target="main" title="Sub-article"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a> element <em>allows</em> for the inclusion of a full
    <a href="n-yww0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;front&gt;</span></a> (which contains both the journal and article metadata)
    for the rare instance in which the journal metadata is different from the parent article.
    Sub-articles also typically inherit the article’s metadata (<a href="n-4uc0.html" target="main"
    title="Article Metadata"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article-meta&gt;</span></a>) unless
    explicitly overridden by using a <a href="n-hvw0.html" target="main" title=
    "&lt;front-stub&gt;"><span class="elementname">Stub Front Metadata</span></a> element or
    <a href="n-yww0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;front&gt;</span></a> element. For example, a sub-article may need its own
    article metadata because it begins on a different page than the primary article, it has
    different authors than the primary article, or it takes different keywords. Usually the goal is
    to keep the <a href="n-hvw0.html" target="main" title="&lt;front-stub&gt;"><span class=
    "elementname">Stub Front Metadata</span></a> of a sub-article as small as possible, listing
    just the article metadata that is different from the main article, but a publisher or archive
    may choose to replicate most or all of the article metadata inside the sub-article for more
    accurate record keeping or retrieval.</p>

    <p class="para">The decision of whether one article should be bundled into another, and thus
    tagged as a sub-article rather than a full article in its own right, is subjective. Publishers
    and archives may wish to establish house guidelines for such decisions.</p>
