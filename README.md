JatsTagLibrary
==============

Looking for the "permalink" user script for the JATS Tag Library pages?  I've moved
that to its own repository, [here](https://github.com/Klortho/jqapi/TagLibPermalink).

This repository is a project to improve the JATS
Tag Library documentation, which can be found here:

  * [Archiving and Interchange - NISO JATS
    1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/)
  * [Publishing - NISO JATS 1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/)
  * [Article Authoring - NISO JATS
    1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.0/)

I am adapting the [jqapi](http://jqapi.com/) documentation framework to work with
the tag library.

Work is being done in [my fork of that
software](https://github.com/Klortho/jqapi/tree/dtdanalyzer), but eventually will
be moved here.
