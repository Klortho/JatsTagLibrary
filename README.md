JatsTagLibrary
==============

This repository contains a few tools exploring different ways to improve the JATS
Tag Library documentation, which can be found here:

  * [Archiving and Interchange - NISO JATS
    1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/)
  * [Publishing - NISO JATS 1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/)
  * [Article Authoring - NISO JATS
    1.0](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.0/)

Alternative Interface to the Tag Suite Library
----------------------------------------------

This is a project that I've started, to adapt the [jqapi](http://jqapi.com/)
documentation framework to the tag library.

Work is being done in [my fork of that software](https://github.com/Klortho/jqapi/tree/dtdanalyzer).


Browser Extension - TagLibPermalink
-----------------------------------

The first (and only, so far) tool is a small browser extension that will add a "permalink" to
each of the documentation pages, making it much easier to bookmark them and to share
links to them.

See the [TagLibPermalink README](TagLibPermalink) for instructions to install and use it.
