    <p class="para">This “Tag Library” is provided as a service to users of ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2011,
    JATS: Journal Article Tag Suite; the Tag Library is not <em>part of</em> NISO Z39.96. It

    <p class="para">The intent of the Journal Article Tag Suite is to provide a common format in
    which publishers and archives can exchange journal content. The Suite provides a set of XML
    schema modules that define elements and attributes for describing the textual and graphical
    content of journal articles as well as some non-article material such as letters, editorials,
    and book and product reviews.</p>

      <h3 class="header">Introduction to the Journal Archiving Tag Set</h3>

      <div class="section">
        <a name="arc-rationale" id="arc-rationale"></a>

        <h4 class="header">Rationale</h4>

        <p class="para">The Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Set (“Journal Archiving Tag Set”)
        defines elements and attributes that describe the content and metadata of journal articles,
        including research and non-research articles, letters, editorials, and book and product
        reviews. This Tag Set allows for descriptions of the full article content or just the
        article header metadata.</p>

        <p class="para">The intent of the Archiving Tag Set is to preserve the intellectual content
        of journals independent of the form in which that content was originally delivered. This
        Tag Set enables an archive to capture structural and semantic components of existing
        material without modeling any particular sequence or textual format.</p>

        <p class="para">It was planned that Archiving could be used for conversion from a variety
        of journal source Tag Sets, with the intent of providing a single format:</p>

        <ul class="bullist">
          <li>in which publishers could deliver their content to a wide range of archives, and</li>

          <li>into which archives could conveniently translate content from many publishers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="para">In order to enable description of the content used by the wide array of
        publishers, repositories, aggregators, etc., this Tag Set uses many loose structures,
        including some elements with nearly all content structures optional. Many attribute values
        in the Tag Set are data character values, accommodating any source values. Because some
        article components are prescriptive in nature, article metadata (<a href="n-jt30.html"
        target="main" title="Article Metadata"><span class=
        "elementtag">&lt;article-meta&gt;</span></a>) for example, the Archiving Tag Set includes a
        few completely generic structures for capturing semantic tagging that is not available
        natively in this Tag Set. Although the original publisher’s publication order cannot always
        be preserved, particularly within the journal and article metadata, the Archiving Tag Set
        works harder than any of the other Tag Sets in this Suite to allow almost any publication
        arrangement and to allow re-tagging as renaming without rearrangement during
        conversion.</p>

        <p class="para">The Archiving Tag Set has a distinct focus on conversion from multiple
        sources. That focus has made this Tag Set a large and inclusive one. Many elements have
        been created explicitly so that information tagged by publishers would not be discarded
        when they converted material from another Tag Set to this one (or one created from this
        Suite). Care has also been taken to provide several mechanisms (frequently, information
        classing attributes) to preserve the intellectual content of a document structure when that
        structure is converted from another Tag Set or schema to this one, even when there is no
        exact element equivalent of the structure.</p>

        <p class="para">The exact replication of the look and feel of any particular journal has
        not been a consideration. Therefore, many purely formatting mechanisms have not been
        included. At the same time, Archiving is intended to preserve observed content, without
        resorting to stylesheets or generation of textual elements. For that reason, labels,
        numbers, and symbols of tables, figures, sidebars, and the like can be recorded as
        elements, as can the punctuation and spaces inside bibliographic references and lists.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <a name="arc-scope" id="arc-scope"></a>

        <h4 class="header">Scope</h4>

        <p class="para">By design, this is a model for journal articles, such as the typical
        research article found in an STM journal, and not a model for complete journals. This Tag
        Set does not include an overarching model for a collection of articles. In addition, the
        following journal material is not described by this Tag Set:</p>

        <ul class="bullist">
          <li>Company, product, or service display advertising</li>

          <li>Job search or classified advertising</li>

          <li>Calendars, meeting schedules, and conference announcements (except as these can be
          tagged as ordinary articles, sub-articles, or sections within articles)</li>

          <li>Material specific to an individual journal, such as Author Guidelines, Policy and
          Scope statements, editorial or advisory boards, detailed indicia, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <a name="arc-overview" id="arc-overview"></a>

        <h4 class="header">Structural Overview</h4>

        <p class="para">The Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Set defines a document that is a
        top-level component of a journal such as an article, a book or product review, or a letter
        to the editor. Each such document is composed of one or more parts; if there is more than
        one part, they must appear in the following order:</p>

        <ul class="bullist">
          <li>Front matter (required). The article front matter contains the metadata for the
          article (also called article header information), for example, the article title, the
          journal in which it appears, the date and issue of publication for that issue of that
          journal, a copyright statement, etc. Both article-level and issue-level metadata (in the
          element <a href="n-jt30.html" target="main" title="Article Metadata"><span class=
          "elementtag">&lt;article-meta&gt;</span></a>) and journal-level metadata (in the element
          <a href="n-qcf0.html" target="main" title="Journal Metadata"><span class=
          "elementtag">&lt;journal-meta&gt;</span></a>) may be captured.<br class="br" />
          This JATS front matter is not textual front matter as appears in books, rather this is
          bibliographic information about the article and the journal in which it was
          published.</li>

          <li>Body of the article (optional). The body of the article is the main textual and
          graphic content of the article. This usually consists of paragraphs and sections, which
          may themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars (boxed text), etc. The body of the
          article is optional to accommodate those repositories that just keep article header
          information and do not tag the textual content.</li>

          <li>Back matter for the article (optional). If present, the article back matter contains
          information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary, appendix, or list of
          cited references.</li>

          <li>Floating Material (optional). A publisher may choose to place all the floating
          objects in an article and its back matter (such as tables, figures, boxed text sidebars,
          etc.) into a separate container element outside the narrative flow for convenience of
          processing.</li>

          <li>Following the front, body, back, and floating material, there may be either one or
          more responses to the article or one or more subordinate articles:

            <ul class="bullist">
              <li>Response. A response is a commentary on the article itself, for example, an
              opinion from an editor on the importance of the article or a reply from the original
              author to a letter concerning his article.</li>

              <li>Sub-article. A sub-article is a small article that is completely contained inside
              another article.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <p class="para">How you use the documentation will depend on what you need to learn about
        the modules and this Tag Set.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <a name="arc-learn-tag-set" id="arc-learn-tag-set"></a>

          <h4 class="header">Learn this Tag Set</h4>

          <p class="para">If you want to learn about the elements and the attributes in this Tag
          Set so you can tag documents or learn how the journal article model is constructed, here
          is a good way to start.</p>

          <ul class="bullist">
            <li>Read the Tag Library General Introduction, taking particular note of the next
            section that describes the parts of the Tag Library so you will know what resources are
            available.</li>

            <li>Next, if you do not know the symbols used in the Document Hierarchy diagrams, read
            the “<a href="n-3kh2.html#arc-nearfar-key">Key to the Near &amp; Far®
            Diagrams</a>”.</li>

            <li>Scan the Document Hierarchy diagrams to get a good sense of the top-level elements
            and their contents. (Find what is inside an <a href="n-ja30.html" target="main" title=
            "Article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a>, now what is inside each
            of the four large pieces of an article, keep working your way down.)</li>

            <li>Pick an element from one of the diagrams. Look up the element in the Elements
            Section to find the full name of the element, its definition, usage notes, content
            allowed, and any attributes. Look up one of the attributes to find its full name, usage
            notes, and potential values.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="para">Finally, if you are interested in conversion from a particular
          source:</p>

          <ul class="bullist">
            <li>Look at an article in a printed or online journal or look at the DTD/schema for the
            other journal.

              <ul class="bullist">
                <li>Can all the information you want to store from an article fit into the models
                shown in the diagrams?</li>

                <li>Do you have, or know how to get, all the information the models require? Will
                that information always be available for documents that are complete and
                correct?</li>

                <li>How difficult will it be to identify the parts of the information using the
                elements and attributes described in these models? Would changes to one or more
                models make this easier?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Now look at some non-article content, such as a news column, a book review, or some
            letters to the editor. Are there tags to handle all these article types and all their
            components?</li>

                DTDs/schemas, and by XML software; and an “element name” (usually longer) that
                provides a fuller, more descriptive name for the benefit of human readers. For
                example, a tag name might be <a href="n-fuv0.html" target="main" title=
                "Quote, Displayed"><span class="elementtag">&lt;disp-quote&gt;</span></a> with the

                tag name might be <a href="n-9822.html" target="main" title=

                shorter, machine-readable names. For example, the attribute short name <a href=
