    <h3 class="header">Tagging Letters and Replies</h3>

    <p class="para">Journals frequently contain correspondence, often in response to
    previously-published articles or to earlier correspondence. This Tag Set has no explicit
    “letter” element or “correspondence” element. An item of correspondence may be adequately
    tagged as a standalone “article” (<a href="n-ysc0.html" target="main" title=
    "Article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a>), with the <a href="n-kgy0.html"
    target="main" title="Type of Article"><span class="attrtag">@article-type</span></a> set
    to:</p>

    <ul class="bullist">
      <li>“letter” for letters that respond to a full-fledged article, or otherwise initiate a
      topic of correspondence;</li>

      <li>“reply” for letters that respond to other letters (one common case is where the author of
      an article responds to correspondence about that article).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">When a series of responses is published in the same issue along with the
    original article, the responses can be tagged inside the original article. A journal might
    choose to consider these as responses to the original article (<a href="n-8ag0.html" target=
    "main" title="Response"><span class="elementtag">&lt;response&gt;</span></a>) or as related
    subordinate articles (<a href="n-uq60.html" target="main" title="Sub-article"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a>), and tag them accordingly. The choice is a
    subjective, editorial decision.</p>

    <p class="para">Ideally, each item in a series of correspondence will link to the item it
    responds to, and to (at least) the first item that responds to it. If the item referred to is
    an article, this can be done with the <a href="n-tdf0.html" target="main" title=
    "Related Article Information"><span class="elementtag">&lt;related-article&gt;</span></a>
    element. If the referring and referred items are both in the same article (as when one or both
    is a <a href="n-8ag0.html" target="main" title="Response"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;response&gt;</span></a> or a <a href="n-uq60.html" target="main" title=
    "Sub-article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a>), this linking can be
    done with the <a href="n-x9i0.html" target="main" title="X (cross) Reference"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;xref&gt;</span></a> element. If the referred item is a sub-article within a
    different article, neither <a href="n-tdf0.html" target="main" title=
    "Related Article Information"><span class="elementtag">&lt;related-article&gt;</span></a> nor
    <a href="n-x9i0.html" target="main" title="X (cross) Reference"><span class=
    "elementtag">&lt;xref&gt;</span></a> suffices, and <a href="n-t9f0.html" target="main" title=
    "Related Object Information"><span class="elementtag">&lt;related-object&gt;</span></a> should
    be used instead.</p>

    <p class="para">In some settings it may be difficult to add links to already-published
    material, so that they may point forward to later responses. In such cases, it is still
    important to have the later responses link back to the material to which they are
    responding.</p>
